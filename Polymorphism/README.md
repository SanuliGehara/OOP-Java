# Polymorphism in Java

Polymorphism simply refers to having many forms. Thre can be two types of polymorphism as,
- Runtime Polymorphism  - Method Overriding
- Compiletime Polymorphism - Method overloading

## Method Overloading

Method name should be same. The idea is that a method can have different versions of it. As an example, 
**void add() method** can be overloaded (can have many versions of it) by giving differend number of parameters or different types of parameters. 
**NOTE: ONLY CHANGING THE RETURN TYPE WON'T DO METHOD OVERLOADING**

Because, for method overloading/ compiletime Polymorphism, which is also refered as **Static Binding** needs to have same method name but different parameteres as it checked in compiletime
